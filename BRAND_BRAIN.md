## 2. Worldview & Philosophy

### The Two Roads Strategy
The brand operates on a bifurcated philosophy — two distinct paths serving different purposes and customers:

#### The Atlas (The Field Journal)
- **Philosophy:** Additive / Designed
- **Context:** "A memory stabilized in oil."
- **Metaphor:** Journey, Voyage, Discovery
- **Products Called:** Waypoints (singular: Waypoint)
- **Classification Label:** Composition
- **Coordinate Meaning:** "Inspiration Point" — The memory or atmosphere this scent captures

#### The Relic (The Vault)
- **Philosophy:** Subtractive / Found
- **Context:** "A material preserved in time."
- **Metaphor:** Artifact, Specimen, Archive
- **Products Called:** Specimens (singular: Specimen)
- **Classification Label:** Single Origin Specimen (or "Heritage Distillation" for traditional co-distillations)
- **Coordinate Meaning:** "Provenance" — The exact harvest site of the material

### Brand Metaphysics
- **Atlas:** We CREATE scents — composing memories into liquid form
- **Relic:** We FIND materials — preserving rare specimens from nature and time
- **The boundary is sacred:** Atlas and Relic never blur into each other

### Key Phrases
- "Four territories. Twenty-four coordinates."
- "Travel by instinct, not itinerary."
- "Navigate by territory. Discover by instinct."
- "Clean. Skin-safe. Cruelty-free."
- "Stabilized via the Tarife Attar system."

## 6. Voice, Tone & Language DNA

| "strong" | Tenacious, Resinous, Potent, Concentrated |
| "cheap" | Accessible, Approachable (but brand avoids this positioning) |

|------|-----|-----------------|
| **Oil & Stone Spring** | Most transitions | stiffness: 100, damping: 20, mass: 1.2 |
| **Liquid Spring** | Large elements | stiffness: 80, damping: 25, mass: 1.5 |
| **Quick Settle** | Micro-interactions | stiffness: 200, damping: 20, mass: 0.8 |

**Animation Variants:**
- **Fade Up:** Content entering from below (y: 20 → 0)
- **Scale In:** Elements growing from center (0.85 → 1)
- **Slide Right:** Panels entering from side
- **Sheet Up:** Mobile sheets rising
- **Stagger Container:** 0.08s stagger, 0.1s delay

**Hover States:**
- **Lift:** y: -4 (gentle elevation)
- **Scale:** 1.02 (subtle growth)
- **Tap:** 0.98 (press feedback)

**CSS Liquid Easing:**
```css
transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.85, 0, 0.15, 1);
```

### Photography Direction
- **Product Images:** Clean backgrounds, dramatic lighting
- **Grayscale default:** Products appear in grayscale, reveal color on hover
- **Scale on hover:** Subtle 1.05 scale increase
- **Aspect ratios:** 4:5 for product cards, various for galleries
- **Quality:** High-resolution, museum-grade presentation

### Border & Shadow Philosophy
- **Borders:** Thin, subtle (`border-theme-charcoal/5` — 5% opacity)
- **Shadows:** Minimal (`shadow-sm`), let content breathe
- **Cards:** White/50 background with blur (`bg-white/50 backdrop-blur-sm`)

### Interface Patterns
- **Spacing:** Generous padding, responsive (`px-4 md:px-24`, `py-20 md:py-48`)
- **Text:** Uppercase mono for labels, tracking widest
- **Transitions:** Always use Oil & Stone timing
- **Mobile:** Compact versions with reduced padding/gaps
