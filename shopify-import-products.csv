sacred-hojari,SACRED HOJARI,"<p><strong>SACRED HOJARI</strong></p>
<h3>Curator's Notes</h3>
<p>A study in altitude and light. This is the 'Royal Green' grade of Boswellia sacra, harvested exclusively from the apex of the Dhofar cliffs where the desert heat meets the monsoonal mist. Unlike common resins, these tears exhibit a bone-white to jade-green translucency, signaling a high concentration of limonene.</p><p>
Upon fractional distillation, the profile is not smoky, but sharp and cooling. It evokes crushed lime peel, eucalyptus, and the dry static of calcified stone. A sacred antiseptic that acts as a vertical clearing for the senses.</p>",Tarife Attär,Relic Collection,Relic,FALSE,,Default Title,RELIC-SACREDHOJARI,,shopify,0,deny,manual,50,,TRUE,TRUE,,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/8h5l91ut/production/5a0d8955d5b6e53d4a2cd11692af3f388e0622fe-1200x1200.png,1,SACRED HOJARI,FALSE,SACRED HOJARI,SACRED HOJARI - Relic Collection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,g,,,draft

<h3>Evocation</h3>
<p>On the banks of the Nile, where the Valley of the Kings holds its ancient dead and the Temple of Karnak still stands after four thousand years, the rituals of adornment have never really stopped.</p>
<p>RITUAL captures that daily devotion. This is white musk at its most elegant—clean and subtle. ISO E Super provides that woody, almost-not-there presence. Ambroxan adds its particular magic.</p>
<p>A very beautiful skin scent that can be worn all day, every day. Not the musk of seduction or statement, but the musk of self-possession.</p>
<h3>On Skin</h3>
<p>ISO E Super opens with characteristic woody transparency—there and not there, felt more than smelled. Light musk provides the softest foundation while Ambroxan adds unique radiance.</p>
<p>A very beautiful skin scent that can be worn all day, every day. Clean and subtle, embodying the quiet elegance of ritual—the daily practice of adorning oneself with intention.</p>",Tarife Attär,Atlas Collection,"Atlas, PETAL",TRUE,Size,12ml,PETAL-RITUAL-12ML,,shopify,1,deny,manual,50,,TRUE,TRUE,,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/8h5l91ut/production/3fb518e60ebffb7872e3ef663ba4152c1b41b71f-1200x1200.jpg,2,RITUAL,FALSE,RITUAL,RITUAL (formerly White Egyptian Musk) - Atlas Collection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,g,,,active
